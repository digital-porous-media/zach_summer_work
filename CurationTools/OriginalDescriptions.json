The fracture sample was designed using the freely available OpenSCAD software (https://openscad.org/). The fracture section consisted of nine intersecting disc-shaped fractures. The fractures overlapped to form a flow-channel from one end of the model to the other end. The zigzagging structure was chosen considering the model size constraints set by the 3D printer and the need to ensure enough flow-channel surface area to obtain effective temperature data. An ultraviolet curing type 3D printer (Agilista 3100, KEYENCE co.) generated a 3D-printed sample consisting of acrylic ultraviolet-curing resin. The flow-channel or cavity space was sculpted by the printer with a support material. After 3D printing the sample object, the water-soluble support material was removed to create a clean fracture structure by washing the 3D-printed sample in an ultrasonic bath for several days. \r\n\r\nThe fracture sample was used for thermal flow experiments.

    "DRP-133.json": "The characterization of carbonate rock structures poses a bigger challenge compared to siliciclastic rocks. This is mainly due to the complex physical and chemical diagenetic processes taking place during their formation. Savonni\u00e8res limestone is an oolitic limestone which is made up of almost spherical grains called ooliths that are held together by cement-like material known as lime mud. Partitioning ooliths and lime mud as well as separating grains into individual ooliths can help in characterizing a variety of properties such as grain/oolith size distribution, as well as contribution of ooliths and lime mud to pore-wall roughness. When spatially correlated, the oolith size distribution can also give an idea about the formation and deposition of those rocks. Additionally, it can be used to correlate oolith sizes and lime\r\nmud thickness to the rock\u2019s geomechanical properties under different stress conditions. The visualization steps followed in this entry include eliminating the jacket surrounding the rock sample and reducing the volume size to help in reducing computational time. The volume extracted is then filtered using anisotropic diffusion, followed by SNN filters to minimize noise while preserving the edges and image details. This step amplifies the difference between pores and solid, which is useful in binary segmentation, where solids are labelled 1 and pores are labelled 0. Next, the original micro-CT images are multiplied by the\r\nbinary segmented images to remove variation in pore spaces and show a stronger signal on the gradient image used in the watershed segmentation protocol. Watershed segmentation is used to separate ooliths from lime mud.

    "DRP-83.json": "X-ray tomography is a powerful tool giving access to the morphology of biofilms, in 3D\r\nporous media, at the mesoscale. Due to the high water content of biofilms, the\r\nattenuation coefficient of biofilms and water are very close, hindering the distinction\r\nbetween biofilms and water without the use of contrast agents. Until now, the use of\r\ncontrast agents such as barium sulfate, silver-coated micro-particles or\r\n1-chloronaphtalene added to the liquid phase allowed imaging the biofilm 3D\r\nmorphology. However, these contrast agents are not passive and potentially interact\r\nwith the biofilm when injected into the sample. Here, we use a natural inorganic\r\ncompound, namely iron sulfate, as a contrast agent progressively bounded in dilute or\r\ncolloidal form into the EPS matrix during biofilm growth. By combining a very long\r\nsource-to-detector distance on a X-ray laboratory source with a Lorentzian filter\r\nimplemented prior to tomographic reconstruction, we substantially increase the contrast\r\nbetween the biofilm and the surrounding liquid, which allows revealing the 3D biofilm\r\nmorphology. Two key advantages of the newly proposed method are that passive addition \r\nof iron sulfate maintains the integrity of the biofilm prior to imaging, and that the biofilm itself\r\nis marked by the contrast agent, rather than the liquid phase as in other available methods.\r\nThe iron sulfate method presented can be applied to understand biofilm development and\r\nbioclogging mechanisms in porous materials and the obtained biofilm morphology could be an ideal\r\nbasis for 3D numerical calculations of hydrodynamic conditions to investigate biofilm-flow coupling.\r\n\r\n- The following data sets are all data sets used in Carrel et al.

These plots show the scCO2 trapped in a Bentheimer sandstone core (A) advanced along the pore network, decreased in volume, and initially was in contact with six surfaces which reduced to four surfaces after the second D-I cycle. The average contact angle increased along two grain surfaces of contact and slightly decreased along the other two surfaces appearing to reach a new state of equilibrium where the strain slightly decreased after the second D-I cycle. With the scCO2 migration, the immediate surrounding pore geometry changed and thus a change in contact angle along the advancing and receding ends occurred. The ganglion trapped in a Nugget sandstone pore (B) increased in volume after the second D-I cycle. Five surfaces of contact were present between cycles with contact angles remaining constant along two surfaces and increasing along the remaining three surfaces. The pore-filling occurrence increased the local strain while the ganglion trapped in a dead-end pore in the Nugget sandstone (C) remained consistent in volume, number of contact surfaces, and the average contact angle along each surface remained unchanged.

Specimens were obtained from Weatherford (Houston, TX, U.S.A.) and had come from a core sample (depth of ~10,400 ft) in the Upper Wolfcamp formation, a hydrocarbon source rock in the Permian basin (Texas,\u00a0U.S.A.). The mudrock is roughly half quartz with the remainder comprising clay minerals (primarily illite), plagioclase and carbonates.  The specimen featured in this project was about 2 cm in length and it contained a vein that was about 5 mm thick.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition to the xCT analyses, 2D analyses (SEM-BSE-QEMSCAN, XRF) and powder XRD were done to identify the minerals in the vein and to quantify their relative amounts. These methods revealed that the first minerals to have precipitated (adjacent to the original fracture wall) were elongate crystals of dolomite as large as 900 microns. These crystals were overlain with a mixture of smaller carbonate crystals including calcite and iron-rich dolomite, interspersed at spatial scales as small as 5 microns. Precipitation of SiO2 was found to fill some of the void space. Quantitative analysis of the segmented 3D xCT image indicated that the vein volume is filled with 62% elongate dolomite crystals, 33% mixed dolomite and calcite, 1% silica, and 4% vuggy void space. Synchrotron X-ray scattering revealed that the vein mineral precipitates had porosity of ~1% and this is much less than the matrix rock porosity.\r\n\r\nThis project was a partnership between Princeton University, the National Energy Technology Lab, the Ohio State University, and Oak Ridge National Lab.\r\n\r\nWe thank Alan Kornacki of Weatherford for providing rock samples that contain mineral-filled veins.

In this database, each sample has two different resolutions: high and low. For the sidewall samples, the high resolution is 6 micrometers (\u00b5m) and the low resolution is 48 \u00b5m. For the plug samples, the high resolution is 8 \u00b5m, while the low resolution is 64 \u00b5m. \r\nThe database comprises grayscale images that have been processed, filtered to reduce artifacts, registered, and cropped. Additionally, it includes segmented files obtained through the Otsu and Watershed methods, enabling a detailed and accurate analysis of sample characteristics.

Among the petrophysical applications, highlights include porosity and permeability analysis, characterization of rock connectivity and heterogeneity, and simulations of more advanced properties on high-resolution images, such as acoustics, wettability, and relative permeability.\r\nFor geology, high-resolution images are particularly useful for investigating the diagenetic processes that impact the rock over time, such as cementation and mineral dissolution. The images allow for a three-dimensional visualization of the texture and internal structure of rocks, facilitating the analysis of mineral distribution, fractures, and heterogeneities.

A sequence of oil and water injections was performed on bead packs with uniform porosity and permeability, but different wettability characteristics. Uniform and mixed wet bead packs with varying degree of wettability were fabricated to analyze how the residual saturation profiles and the distribution of fluid phases at the pore scale respond to changes in wettability. X ray microtomography was used to visualize and analyze the fluid distribution in each bead pack at the end of oil and brine injection. It was found that sweep efficiency was high for the uniform, strongly wetting glass bead pack. For the intermediate wet plastic bead pack, we observed evidence of viscous fingering resulting in degenerating sweep efficiency after water injection. In media with mixed wetting surfaces, the spatial distribution of wettability influenced the topology of the saturation profiles and resulted in larger quantities of disconnected fluid blobs. Results also showed that the average blob size was independent of the average residual saturation. In addition, the difference in saturation conditions preceding each injection affected sweep efficiency. The residual saturation after the 1st displacement was higher than the residual saturation after the 2nd displacement.\r\nThe provided data consists of the raw images and the segmented images of three different samples. The samples were identified by experiment conducted as follows:\r\n1. Experiment I was conducted using a plastic bead pack with a 78.69 mm length.\r\n2.

    "DRP-140.json": "Flow and transport within porous- and microtextured-walled channels is relevant to a number of natural and industrial processes. Designing and optimizing the topology of the pores and/or microstructure to achieve target performance at the system-scale (or macroscale) is still an open question. Fully-resolved three-dimensional pore-scale simulations  are the most accurate representation of the actual experiment or system, but their computational burden may be prohibitively high. A continuum treatment of the micropattern   can significantly reduce the computational cost of the numerical solver. Yet, the underlying approximations of macroscale models developed in the context of porous-walled channels (or channel-matrix systems) have rarely been experimentally tested, quantified  nor validated.  In this work, we study whether hydrodynamic dispersion in microfluidic channels with walls structured by obstacles can be modelled by dispersion in channels with porous walls described as continuous porous media of zero or  finite permeability.  We perform microfluidic experiments in channels embedded in micropatterns with different topologies. Specifically, we focus on transverse riblets and arrays of pillars as examples of impermeable and permeable obstructions, respectively.  We  compare the experimental results with three models: 3D pore-scale  simulations which resolve the micropattern geometry explicitly and two upscaled models which treat the micropattern as a continuum of zero or finite permeability. This study demonstrates that  polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micromodels with appropriately  patterned surfaces can be successfully employed to validate various continuum-scale modelling approximations  in different physical regimes, identified by the order of magnitude of Peclet number and the obstruction permeability.",

Within the bulk of this rock, patches of several cubic centimeters with a different microstructure and a lower porosity occur seemingly randomly (Boone et al., 2014). The bulk, from which the sample used in this work was selected, has a porosity of 11.6% (measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) to avoid averaging the porosity of the bulk and the patches) (Boone et al., 2014). It contains interparticular moldic macropores due to dedolomitization. The macropore network may or may not percolate, depending on the local amount of (de)dolomitization. Depending on this, permeability can range from 70 mD (measured by portable permeameter) to values on the order of 0.03 mD. Microporosity can be found in the partially dissolved dolomite lining the molds and in local ooids.",

The experiments were imaged at 12 s per scan with a voxel size of 14.6 \u00b5m (Bultreys et al., 2016).

    "DRP-229.json": "This dataset contains raw and segmented X-Ray micro-tomography images from steady-state drainage and imbibition flow experiments in two distinct Bentheimer sandstones. The dataset is presented and utilised in the paper 'Representative elementary volumes, hysteresis and heterogeneity in multiphase flow from the pore to continuum scale' available at: https://eartharxiv.org/2aejr/. Full details of the experimental setup, procedure and imaging analysis can be found in the paper and supporting information. \r\n\r\nThe experiments consist of steady-state co-injection core floods with micro-CT imaging and simulatenous pressure measurments, performed on two Bentheimer sandstone cores. These cores have a diameter of 12.35mm (cored with a 12.7mm,1/2\"drill bit), and length 73.2mm and 64.7mm, with core-averged porosities of 0.203 and 0.223 respectively. The shallow-marine Bentheimer sandstone typically consists of around 95% quartz with minor feldspar and clay and has a well-sorted grain size distribution. The first core is relatively homogeneous, whilst the second has oblique, low porosity layers orientated approximately 60 degrees to the flow direction. Brine (3.5wt.%KI) and decane (99.9%pure, Sigma-Aldrich) are used as wetting and non-wetting phases respectively, with an interfacial tension of appromxiately 51.16 mN/m (for the pure DI water - decanesystem). The outcrop Bentheimer is strongly water-wetting. \r\n\r\nThe experiments are performed with a confining pressure of 4.5MPa, and pore-pressure of 1.5MPa. Scans are performed with a Zeiss Versa 510 X-Ray microscope with a flat panel detector and various microscope objectives. Firstly, a full-core dry scan is obtained, at a resolution of 6 microns. The core is then saturated with high salinity brine (30wt.%KI), and a full core scan obtained for differential imaging purposes. The working fluid brine (3.5wt.%KI) is then pumped through the core, fully displacing the high-salinity brine, and the absolute permeability is measured. Following this, decane and brine are co-injected into the core at constant total flow rate (0.1 ml/min) varying the fractional flow in a drainage and imbibition process. At each fractional flow, once the differential pressure has stabilised a full-core scan is taken followed by zoom-in, region of interest scans.\r\n\r\nFor the 'full core' scans, 11 and 10 individual scans are taken at increasing vertical locations in each core, to cover a total volume after processing of 1950 x 1950 x 10800 voxels (11.7mm x 11.7mm x 64.8mm) and 1900 x 1900 x 9550 voxels (11.4mm x 11.4mm x 57.3mm) in core 1 and 2 respectively. Approximately 5mm is lost from the images near the inlet and outlet of the core due to noise from the end-pieces and the cone angle of the X-Ray beam. There is significant overlap between each scan to allow registration and merging of the full image. Each individual scan image is normalised to pre-selected references to obtain consistent grey-scale values throughout the core, registered with the first scan, and then merged to create a single image of the core. These are the 'raw' scans available in this data set.  After each full-core scan, a selection of zoom-in, region of interest scans are performed to facilitate the interfacial curvature measurements in the paper.  A 4x microscope objective lens is used to aquire each image, with the detector position varied to achieve a 3.5 micron resolution and 2 micron resolution image, each containing 1000 cubed voxels. These are the raw, ROI scans available in the dataset. \r\n\r\nThe segmented images are also available in the data set for the full core and region of interest scans. The segmented images show the connected and disconnected oil for the full core scans (binary images with 1 being the oil), and grain, water and total oil for the region of the interest images. Alongside this, the segmented porosity map is also available, which was generated through segmentation of the differential image (high salinity and dry raw images). Details of the differential segmentation and watershed segmented used for the fluid phases can be found in the paper.\r\n\r\nThe full core images herein have been divided into 50 equal subvolumes to faciliate downloading and utilising the dataset with small CPU and RAM requirements. The full, merged images can be found on the UKCCSRC data repository.\r\n\r\nAll resolution data is contained within the file name: full_core means 6um, 3_45 means 3.45 microns, 3_5 means 3.5 microns and 2_00 means 2 microns. Absolute voxel sizes in the images may differ but can be changed in settings to match the given scan resolutions mentioned previously. Also contained in the file names are the oil fractional flow and flood process. DraFo05 refers to a drainage step with a fractional flow of oil of 0.05.

The voxel size for every dataset is 20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 nm3. Specifically, (Ca,Cd)CO3 solid solution and (Ca,Cd,Zn)CO3 solid solution samples were scanned. \r\n\r\nThe samples were experimentally synthesized from aqueous solutions that were supersaturated with respect to all carbonate mineral endmembers: calcite, otavite, and smithsonite.

Additionally, we uploaded the voxel-registered data of the (Ca,Cd,Zn)CO3 particle, which is the end result of spatially registering the voxels in the scans at 8.000 keV and 9.675 keV .

Analyses revealed rich nano-scale compositional heterogeneity within individual particles.
